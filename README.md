  ## FAQ

  **Where is my data stored?**
  Everything stays on your device. No accounts, no cloud sync, no tracking.

  **The soundscapes aren't playing?**
  Click anywhere on the page first - browsers require user interaction before playing audio.

  **How do I reset everything?**
  Right-click the extension icon → Options → scroll to bottom → Reset.
